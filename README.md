# DOSDOSDOS

### In this project.. I learned how to:
- Configure Nginx with DoS mitigation rules, including rate limiting for requests and connections, and aggressive timeouts for slow connections. 
- Use Nginx Amplify to monitor server connections and confirm the effectiveness of DoS mitigation rules during a Slowloris attack. 
- Analyze .pcap files in Wireshark to differentiate between vulnerable server traffic (showing open, unclosed connections) and mitigated server traffic (showing TCP resets and port reuse from the server).
